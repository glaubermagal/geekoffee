This block of code does not work:
```
try {
    setTimeout(function () {
        throw new Error('error!');
    }, 300)
} catch (e) {
    console.log('Caught error: ', e)
}
```

Functions scheduled to run with setTimeout are executed in the main loop, outside the scope of the block that originated them.

Therefore, to handle errors, change the order of `try-catch` and `setTimeout`, like this:


```
setTimeout(function () {
    try {
        throw new Error('error!');   
    } catch (e) {
        console.log('Caught error: ', e)
    }
}, 300)
```
